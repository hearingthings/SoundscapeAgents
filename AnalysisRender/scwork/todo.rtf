\f0\fs18 \cf0 TODO:\
- write logdata filtering synthdefs\
- refactor chain so that it can handle kr filters after the data\
- make dictionary of synthdefs so that you don't need to use the classname in the spec\
- log continuous data as well, not just on/off points\
\
- have a way to compare data from the various chains within a single synthdef\
\
AContinuousLogger (fftcrest)\
ADiscreteLogger (onsets)\
AComboLogger (fftcrest -> filter) //encapsulates 2 loggers\
